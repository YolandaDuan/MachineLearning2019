Each sample in the dataset (“Hog-Feat.txt”) is associated with a specific image containing a group of two people. 
In the file “Hog-Feat-with-image-file-names.txt” each sample includes the file name of the image associated with that sample.

Each sample contains 100 body features. These include 50 Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients (PHOG) for each of the main bodies detected in the images.

If you are interested in more information about how the features are calculated, see:

The dataset also includes a label for each sample. 
This describes the emotion expressed by the group of people. This can be either "positive", "negative" or "neutral".
